# Student Feedback Sentiment Classifier  

This is a small machine learning project that classifies short student feedback comments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using Python and scikit-learn.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple, end-to-end ML workflow:
- creating a labeled dataset
- vectorizing text with TF-IDF
- training a Logistic Regression classifier
- evaluating model performance
- running an interactive prediction loop
